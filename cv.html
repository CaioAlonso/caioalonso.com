<h2>I make simple things that work.</h2>

<p>Caio Alonso, programmer. São Paulo, Brazil.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/CaioAlonso">https://github.com/CaioAlonso</a></p>

<p>I'm 25 years old. I've been programming professionally since I was 17. At 19 I quit college to start my own company with two of my best friends. After a while doing that, I decided to try new things.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a job where I can use my current experience while having to expand my skills quickly and constantly.</p>

<h3>Formal education</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>High school</b><br>
        Colégio Castro Alves, finished in 2008</li>
    <li><b>Bachelor's degree</b><br>Information Systems at Universidade de São Paulo<br>
        did two years, starting in 2009</li>
</ul>

<h3>Work history</h3>
<p>When I was in high school, I redid the school website in Joomla, including with a system for students to see their grades. That was my first experience with a paid client and all the intricacies of project management, company politics and marketing.</p>

<p>After that and until 2009, I kept doing small design and programming jobs while studying at USP.</p>

<p>In 2010 I started Codex3 Comunicação. The 3 stands for the three different areas we would cover: graphical design, web and marketing. You would hire us and we would take care of all of it with a cohesive strategy.</p>

<p>At Codex3 I did pretty much everything:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Client prospecting, cold calls, pamphleting etc</li>
  <li>Sales, negotiations</li>
  <li>Managing simultaneous projects</li>
  <li>Managing subcontractors and employees</li>
  <li>Visual identities</li>
  <li>Marketing strategies</li>
  <li>The whole publishing process of magazines, books, business cards etc</li>
  <li><b>But what I really loved was:</b></li>
  <li>Full stack webdesign</li>
  <li>Ecommerces</li>
  <li>Redesigns of existing sites</li>
  <li>Ruby on Rails systems</li>
  <li>Crawlers in Python to acquire data from many (sometimes broken) sites</li>
  <li>User eXperience</li>
  <li>Usability</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2014, I joined a startup called 10SAFIE ('desafie', to challenge in portuguese) which intended to enter the brazilian soccer market with an Android application that helped the team's technical crew to record and index each aspect of the game and produce a statistical analysis.<p>

<p>There I had the chance to do a bit of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The whole company visual identity (logos, stationery etc)</li>
    <li>The website</li>
    <li>The Android app</li>
</ul>

<p>The timing wasn't right and we didn't find success. But we learned a lot.</p>

<p>In 2015 we tried again, this time with a t-shirt company, 10z:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ecommerce in OpenCart integrated to a custom-made ERP in Ruby on Rails</li>
    <li>Full design of the company's identity and website</li>
    <li>Product design, sales, and managing of suppliers</li>
</ul>

<p>And for the past year I have been:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Investing in the Foreign Exchange Market (FOREX) and building my own trader bot</li>
    <li>Building <a href="https://taquente.com.br">taquente.com.br</a>, an affiliate marketing discount site in Go and Javascript.</li>
</ul>
